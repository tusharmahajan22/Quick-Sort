# Quick-Sort
// Why Quick Sort is preferred over MergeSort for sorting Arrays ?
// Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive.
// Time Complexity ----> best and avg --->O(n logn)---->worst ----> O(n^2) where n---> size of an array
// Space Complexity ----> O(n)

// Quick sort is preferred for arrays whereas Merge sort is preferred for linked lists.
// Quicksort is generally considered the “fastest” sorting algorithm.
